.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module provides a way to process \s-1XML\s0 documents. It is build on top
of \f(CW\*(C`XML::Parser\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing you
to output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
.PP
It allows minimal resource (\s-1CPU\s0 and memory) usage by building the tree
only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing, through the 
use of the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots \*(C'\fR and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`twig_print_outside_roots \*(C'\fR options. The 
\&\f(CW\*(C`finish \*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`finish_print \*(C'\fR methods also help 
to increase performances.
.PP
XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to takes care 
of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes necessary) features that 
come with \s-1XML\s0 and XML::Parser.
.SH "XML::Twig 101"
.IX Header "XML::Twig 101"
XML::Twig can be used either on \*(L"small\*(R" \s-1XML\s0 documents (that fit in memory)
or on huge ones, by processing parts of the document and outputting or
discarding them once they are processed.
.Sh "Loading an \s-1XML\s0 document and processing it"
.IX Subsection "Loading an XML document and processing it"
.Vb 10
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new();
\&  $t\->parse( '<d><title>title</title><para>p 1</para><para>p 2</para></d>');
\&  my $root= $t\->root;
\&  $root\->set_tag( 'html');              # change doc to html
\&  $title= $root\->first_child( 'title'); # get the title
\&  $title\->set_tag( 'h1');               # turn it into h1
\&  my @para= $root\->children( 'para');   # get the para children
\&  foreach my $para (@para)
\&    { $para\->set_tag( 'p'); }           # turn them into p
\&  $t\->print;                            # output the document
.Ve
.PP
Other useful methods include:
.PP
att: \f(CW\*(C`$elt\->{'att'}\->{'foo'}\*(C'\fR return the \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR attribute for an 
element,
.PP
set_att : \f(CW\*(C`$elt\->set_att( foo => "bar")\*(C'\fR sets the \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR 
attribute to the \f(CW\*(C`bar\*(C'\fR value,
.PP
next_sibling: \f(CW\*(C`$elt\->{next_sibling}\*(C'\fR return the next sibling
in the document (in the example \f(CW\*(C`$title\->{next_sibling}\*(C'\fR is the first
\&\f(CW\*(C`para\*(C'\fR, you can also (and actually should) use 
\&\f(CW\*(C`$elt\->next_sibling( 'para')\*(C'\fR to get it 
.PP
The document can also be transformed through the use of the cut, 
copy, paste and move methods: 
\&\f(CW\*(C`$title\->cut; $title\->paste( after => $p);\*(C'\fR for example
.PP
And much, much more, see Elt.
.Sh "Processing an \s-1XML\s0 document chunk by chunk"
.IX Subsection "Processing an XML document chunk by chunk"
One of the strengths of XML::Twig is that it let you work with files that do 
not fit in memory (\s-1BTW\s0 storing an \s-1XML\s0 document in memory as a tree is quite
memory\-expensive, the expansion factor being often around 10).
.PP
To do this you can define handlers, that will be called once a specific 
element has been completely parsed. In these handlers you can access the
element and process it as you see fit, using the navigation and the
cut-n-paste methods, plus lots of convenient ones like \f(CW\*(C`prefix \*(C'\fR.
Once the element is completely processed you can then \f(CW\*(C`flush \*(C'\fR it, 
which will output it and free the memory. You can also \f(CW\*(C`purge \*(C'\fR it 
if you don't need to output it (if you are just extracting some data from 
the document for example). The handler will be called again once the next 
relevant element has been parsed.
.PP
.Vb 8
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_handlers => 
\&                          { section => \e&section,
\&                            para   => sub { $_\->set_tag( 'p');
\&                          },
\&                       );
\&  $t\->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
\&  $t\->flush; # don't forget to flush one last time in the end or anything
\&             # after the last </section> tag will not be output
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  # the handler is called once a section is completely parsed, ie when 
\&  # the end tag for section is found, it receives the twig itself and
\&  # the element (including all its sub\-elements) as arguments
\&  sub section 
\&    { my( $t, $section)= @_;      # arguments for all twig_handlers
\&      $section\->set_tag( 'div');  # change the tag name.4, my favourite method...
\&      # let's use the attribute nb as a prefix to the title
\&      my $title= $section\->first_child( 'title'); # find the title
\&      my $nb= $title\->{'att'}\->{'nb'}; # get the attribute
\&      $title\->prefix( "$nb \- ");  # easy isn't it?
\&      $section\->flush;            # outputs the section and frees memory
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
There is of course more to it: you can trigger handlers on more elaborate 
conditions than just the name of the element, \f(CW\*(C`section/title\*(C'\fR for example.
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_handlers => 
\&                           { 'section/title' => sub { $_\->print } }
\&                       )
\&                  \->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
.Ve
.PP
Here \f(CW\*(C`sub { $_\->print }\*(C'\fR simply prints the current element (\f(CW$_\fR is aliased
to the element in the handler).
.PP
You can also trigger a handler on a test on an attribute:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_handlers => 
\&                      { 'section[@level="1"]' => sub { $_\->print } }
\&                       );
\&                  \->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
.Ve
.PP
You can also use \f(CW\*(C`start_tag_handlers \*(C'\fR to process an 
element as soon as the start tag is found. Besides \f(CW\*(C`prefix \*(C'\fR you
can also use \f(CW\*(C`suffix \*(C'\fR, 
.Sh "Processing just parts of an \s-1XML\s0 document"
.IX Subsection "Processing just parts of an XML document"
The twig_roots mode builds only the required sub-trees from the document
Anything outside of the twig roots will just be ignored:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( 
\&       # the twig will include just the root and selected titles 
\&           twig_roots   => { 'section/title' => \e&print_n_purge,
\&                             'annex/title'   => \e&print_n_purge
\&           }
\&                      );
\&  $t\->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  sub print_n_purge 
\&    { my( $t, $elt)= @_;
\&      print $elt\->text;    # print the text (including sub\-element texts)
\&      $t\->purge;           # frees the memory
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
You can use that mode when you want to process parts of a documents but are
not interested in the rest and you don't want to pay the price, either in
time or memory, to build the tree for the it.
.Sh "Building an \s-1XML\s0 filter"
.IX Subsection "Building an XML filter"
You can combine the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR and the \f(CW\*(C`twig_print_outside_roots\*(C'\fR options to 
build filters, which let you modify selected elements and will output the rest 
of the document as is.
.PP
This would convert prices in $ to prices in Euro in a document:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( 
\&           twig_roots   => { 'price' => \e&convert, },   # process prices 
\&           twig_print_outside_roots => 1,               # print the rest
\&                      );
\&  $t\->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
.Ve
.PP
.Vb 12
\&  sub convert 
\&    { my( $t, $price)= @_;
\&      my $currency=  $price\->{'att'}\->{'currency'};          # get the currency
\&      if( $currency eq 'USD')
\&        { $usd_price= $price\->text;                     # get the price
\&          # %rate is just a conversion table 
\&          my $euro_price= $usd_price * $rate{usd2euro};
\&          $price\->set_text( $euro_price);               # set the new price
\&          $price\->set_att( currency => 'EUR');          # don't forget this!
\&        }
\&      $price\->print;                                    # output the price

reasonable configurations.
.PP
The \*(L"recommended configuration\*(R" is perl 5.8.3+ (for good Unicode
support), XML::Parser 2.31+ and expat 1.95.5+
.PP

XML::Twig provides the \f(CW\*(C`safe_parse \*(C'\fR and the

Attributes with a name starting with # (illegal in \s-1XML\s0) will not be

not just text, it's just a regular Perl variable, so a reference to
an object or a huge data structure is perfectly fine.

XML::Twig uses a very limited number of classes. The ones you are most likely to use
are \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig\*(C'\fR of course, which represents a complete \s-1XML\s0 document, including the 
document itself (the root of the document itself is \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR), its handlers, its
input or output filters... The other main class is \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Elt\*(C'\fR, which models 
an \s-1XML\s0 element. Element here has a very wide definition: it can be a regular element, or
but also text, with an element \f(CW\*(C`tag\*(C'\fR of \f(CW\*(C`#PCDATA\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`#CDATA\*(C'\fR), an entity (tag is

.PP
You might want to look the \f(CW\*(C`elt_class\*(C'\fR option if you want to subclass \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Elt\*(C'\fR.

Attributes are just attached to their parent element, they are not objects per se. (Please
use the provided methods \f(CW\*(C`att\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`set_att\*(C'\fR to access them, if you access them
as a hash, then your code becomes implementaion deppndant and might break in the future).

Other classes that are seldom used are \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Entity_list\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Entity\*(C'\fR.

.IP "twig_handlers" 4
.IX Item "twig_handlers"
This argument replaces the corresponding XML::Parser argument. It consists
of a hash \f(CW\*(C`{ expression =\*(C'\fR \e&handler}> where expression is a 
\&\fIgeneric_attribute_condition\fR, \fIstring_condition\fR,
an \fIattribute_condition\fR,\fIfull_path\fR, a \fIpartial_path\fR, a \fItag\fR,
a \fItag_regexp\fR, \fI_default_\fR or \fI_all_\fR.
.Sp
The idea is to support a usefull but efficient (thus limited) subset of
\&\s-1XPATH\s0. A fuller expression set will be supported in the future, as users
ask for more and as I manage to implement it efficiently. This will never
encompass all of \s-1XPATH\s0 due to the streaming nature of parsing (no lookahead
after the element end tag).
.Sp
A \fBgeneric_attribute_condition\fR is a condition on an attribute, in the form
\&\f(CW\*(C`*[@att="val"]\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*[@att]\*(C'\fR, simple quotes can be used instead of double 
quotes and the leading '*' is actually optional. No matter what the tag of the
element is, the handler will be triggered either if the attribute has the 
specified value or if it just exists. 
.Sp
A \fBstring_condition\fR is a condition on the content of an element, in the form
\&\f(CW\*(C`tag[string()="foo"]\*(C'\fR, simple quotes can be used instead of double quotes, at 
the moment you cannot escape the quotes (this will be added as soon as I
dig out my copy of Mastering Regular Expressions from its storage box).
The text returned is, as per what I (and Matt Sergeant!) understood from
the \s-1XPATH\s0 spec the concatenation of all the text in the element, excluding
all markup. Thus to call a handler on the element\f(CW\*(C`<p>text <b>bold</b></p>\*(C'\fR
the appropriate condition is \f(CW\*(C`p[string()="text bold"]\*(C'\fR. Note that this is not
exactly conformant to the \s-1XPATH\s0 spec, it just tries to mimic it while being
still quite concise. 
.Sp
A extension of that notation is \f(CW\*(C`tag[string(\f(CBchild_tag\f(CW)="foo"]\*(C'\fR where the
handler will be called if a child of a \f(CW\*(C`tag\*(C'\fR element has a text value of 
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR.  At the moment only direct children of the \f(CW\*(C`tag\*(C'\fR element are checked.
If you need to test on descendants of the element let me know. The fix is
trivial but would slow down the checks, so I'd like to keep it the way it is.
.Sp
A \fBregexp_condition\fR is a condition on the content of an element, in the form
\&\f(CW\*(C`tag[string()=~ /foo/"]\*(C'\fR. This is the same as a string condition except that
the text of the element is matched to the regexp. The \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`m\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`s\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`o\*(C'\fR
modifiers can be used on the regexp.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`tag[string(\f(CBchild_tag\f(CW)=~ /foo/"]\*(C'\fR extension is also supported.
.Sp
An \fBattribute_condition\fR is a simple condition of an attribute of the
current element in the form \f(CW\*(C`tag[@att="val"]\*(C'\fR (simple quotes can be used
instead of double quotes, you can escape quotes either). 
If several attribute_condition are true the same element all the handlers
can be called in turn (in the order in which they were first defined).
If the \f(CW\*(C`="val"\*(C'\fR part is ommited ( the condition is then \f(CW\*(C`tag[@att]\*(C'\fR) then
the handler is triggered if the attribute actually exists for the element,
no matter what it's value is.
.Sp
A \fBfull_path\fR looks like \f(CW'/doc/section/chapter/title'\fR, it starts with
a / then lists all the tags to the element. The handler will be called if
the path to the current element (in the input document) is exactly as
defined by the \f(CW\*(C`full_path\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
A \fBpartial_path\fR is like a full_path except it does not start with a /:
\&\f(CW'chapter/title'\fR for example. The handler will be called if the path to
the element (in the input document) ends as defined in the \f(CW\*(C`partial_path\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: (hopefully temporary) at the moment \f(CW\*(C`string_condition\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`regexp_condition\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`attribute_condition\*(C'\fR are only supported on a 
simple tag, not on a path.
.Sp
A \fBtag_regexp\fR is a regular expression (created with \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR), applied to 
the tag name. For example \f(CW\*(C`qr/^h\ed$/i\*(C'\fR would match \f(CW\*(C`h1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`H1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`h2\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`H2\*(C'\fR... 
.Sp
A \fBtag\fR.
.Sp
#CDATA can be used to call a handler for a \s-1CDATA\s0.
.Sp
A special tag \fB_all_\fR is used to call a function for each element.
The special tag \fB_default_\fR is used to call a handler for each element
that does \s-1NOT\s0 have a specific handler.
.Sp
The order of precedence to trigger a handler is: 
\&\fIgeneric_attribute_condition\fR, \fIstring_condition\fR, \fIregexp_condition\fR, 
\&\fIattribute_condition\fR, \fIfull_path\fR, longer \fIpartial_path\fR, shorter 
\&\fIpartial_path\fR, \fItag_regexp\fR, \fItag\fR, \fI_default_\fR . 
.Sp
\&\fBImportant\fR: once a handler has been triggered if it returns 0 then no other
handler is called, exept a \f(CW\*(C`_all_\*(C'\fR handler which will be called anyway.
.Sp
If a handler returns a true value and other handlers apply, then the next
applicable handler will be called. Repeat, rince, lather..; The exception
to that rule is when the \f(CW\*(C`do_not_chain_handlers\*(C'\fR
option is set, in which case only the first handler will be called.
.Sp
Note that it might be a good idea to explicitely return a short true value
(like 1) from handlers: this ensures that other applicable handlers are 
called even if the last statement for the handler happens to evaluate to
false. This might also speedup the code by avoiding the result of the last 
statement of the code to be copied and passed to the code managing handlers.
It can really pay to have 1 instead of a long string returned.
.Sp
When an element is \s-1CLOSED\s0 the corresponding handler is called, with 2
arguments: the twig and the \f(CW\*(C`/Element \*(C'\fR. The twig includes the 
document tree that has been built so far, the element is the complete sub-tree
for the element. This means that handlers for inner elements are called before
handlers for outer elements.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$_\fR is also set to the element, so it is easy to write inline handlers like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  para => sub { $_\->set_tag( 'p'); }
.Ve
.Sp
Text is stored in elements whose tag is #PCDATA (due to mixed content, text
and sub-element in an element there is no way to store the text as just an
attribute of the enclosing element).
.Sp
\&\fBWarning\fR: if you have used purge or flush on the twig the element might not
be complete, some of its children might have been entirely flushed or purged,
and the start tag might even have been printed (by \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR) already, so changing
its tag might not give the expected result.
.Sp
More generally, the \fIfull_path\fR, \fIpartial_path\fR, \fItag\fR and \fItag_regexp\fR 
expressions are
evaluated against the input document. Which means that even if you have changed
the tag of an element (changing the tag of a parent element from a handler for
example) the change will not impact the expression evaluation. Attributes in
\&\fIattribute_condition\fR are different though. As the initial value of attribute
is not stored the handler will be triggered if the \fBcurrent\fR attribute/value
pair is found when the element end tag is found. Although this can be quite
confusing it should not impact most of users, and allow others to play clever
tricks with temporary attributes. Let me know if this is a problem for you.
.IP "twig_roots" 4
.IX Item "twig_roots"
This argument let's you build the tree only for those elements you are
interested in. 
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  Example: my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_roots => { title => 1, subtitle => 1});

.Ve
.Sp
return a twig containing a document including only \f(CW\*(C`title\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`subtitle\*(C'\fR 
elements, as children of the root element.
.Sp
You can use \fIgeneric_attribute_condition\fR, \fIattribute_condition\fR,
\&\fIfull_path\fR, \fIpartial_path\fR, \fItag\fR, \fItag_regexp\fR, \fI_default_\fR and 
\&\fI_all_\fR to trigger the building of the twig. 
\&\fIstring_condition\fR and \fIregexp_condition\fR cannot be used as the content 
of the element, and the string, have not yet been parsed when the condition
is checked.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: path are checked for the document. Even if the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR option
is used they will be checked against the full document tree, not the virtual
tree created by XML::Twig
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: twig_roots elements should \s-1NOT\s0 be nested, that would hopelessly
confuse XML::Twig ;\-\-(
.Sp
Note: you can set handlers (twig_handlers) using twig_roots
  Example: my \f(CW$t\fR= XML::Twig\->new( twig_roots => 
                                   { title    => sub { \f(CW$_\fR{1]\->print;}, 
                                     subtitle => \e&process_subtitle 
                                   }
                               );
           \f(CW$t\fR\->parsefile( file);
.IP "twig_print_outside_roots" 4
.IX Item "twig_print_outside_roots"
To be used in conjunction with the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR argument. When set to a true 
value this will print the document outside of the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR elements.
.Sp
.Vb 12
\& Example: my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_roots => { title => \e&number_title },
\&                                twig_print_outside_roots => 1,
\&                               );

\&           { my $nb;
\&           sub number_title
\&             { my( $twig, $title);
\&               $nb++;
\&               $title\->prefix( "$nb "; }
\&               $title\->print;
\&             }
\&           }
.Ve
.Sp
This example prints the document outside of the title element, calls 
\&\f(CW\*(C`number_title\*(C'\fR for each \f(CW\*(C`title\*(C'\fR element, prints it, and then resumes printing
the document. The twig is built only for the \f(CW\*(C`title\*(C'\fR elements. 
.Sp
If the value is a reference to a file handle then the document outside the
\&\f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR elements will be output to this file handle:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  open( OUT, ">out_file") or die "cannot open out file out_file:$!";
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( twig_roots => { title => \e&number_title },

\&               $title\->print( \e*OUT);    # you have to print to \e*OUT here
\&             }
\&           }
.Ve
.IP "start_tag_handlers" 4
.IX Item "start_tag_handlers"
A hash \f(CW\*(C`{ expression =\*(C'\fR \e&handler}>. Sets element handlers that are called when
the element is open (at the end of the XML::Parser \f(CW\*(C`Start\*(C'\fR handler). The handlers
are called with 2 params: the twig and the element. The element is empty at 
that point, its attributes are created though. 
.Sp
You can use \fIgeneric_attribute_condition\fR, \fIattribute_condition\fR,
\&\fIfull_path\fR, \fIpartial_path\fR, \fItag\fR, \fItag_regexp\fR, \fI_default_\fR  and \fI_all_\fR 
to trigger the handler. 
.Sp
\&\fIstring_condition\fR and \fIregexp_condition\fR cannot be used as the content of 
the element, and the string, have not yet been parsed when the condition is 
checked.
.Sp
The main uses for those handlers are to change the tag name (you might have to 
do it as soon as you find the open tag if you plan to \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR the twig at some
point in the element, and to create temporary attributes that will be used
when processing sub-element with \f(CW\*(C`twig_hanlders\*(C'\fR. 
.Sp
You should also use it to change tags if you use \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR. If you change the tag 
in a regular \f(CW\*(C`twig_handler\*(C'\fR then the start tag might already have been flushed. 
.Sp
\&\fBNote\fR: \f(CW\*(C`start_tag\*(C'\fR handlers can be called outside of \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR if this 
argument is used, in this case handlers are called with the following arguments:
\&\f(CW$t\fR (the twig), \f(CW$tag\fR (the tag of the element) and \f(CW%att\fR (a hash of the 
attributes of the element). 
.Sp
If the \f(CW\*(C`twig_print_outside_roots\*(C'\fR argument is also used, if the last handler
called returns  a \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR value, then the the start tag will be output as it
appeared in the original document, if the handler returns a a \f(CW\*(C`false\*(C'\fR value
then the start tag will \fBnot\fR be printed (so you can print a modified string 
yourself for example).
.Sp
Note that you can use the ignore method in \f(CW\*(C`start_tag_handlers\*(C'\fR 
(and only there). 
.IP "end_tag_handlers" 4
.IX Item "end_tag_handlers"
A hash \f(CW\*(C`{ expression =\*(C'\fR \e&handler}>. Sets element handlers that are called when
the element is closed (at the end of the XML::Parser \f(CW\*(C`End\*(C'\fR handler). The handlers
are called with 2 params: the twig and the tag of the element. 
.Sp
\&\fItwig_handlers\fR are called when an element is completely parsed, so why have 
this redundant option? There is only one use for \f(CW\*(C`end_tag_handlers\*(C'\fR: when using
the \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR option, to trigger a handler for an element \fBoutside\fR the roots.
It is for example very useful to number titles in a document using nested 
sections: 
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&  my @no= (0);
\&  my $no;
\&  my $t= XML::Twig\->new( 
\&          start_tag_handlers => 
\&           { section => sub { $no[$#no]++; $no= join '.', @no; push @no, 0; } },
\&          twig_roots         => 
\&           { title   => sub { $_[1]\->prefix( $no); $_[1]\->print; } },
\&          end_tag_handlers   => { section => sub { pop @no;  } },
\&          twig_print_outside_roots => 1
\&                      );
\&   $t\->parsefile( $file);
.Ve
.Sp
Using the \f(CW\*(C`end_tag_handlers\*(C'\fR argument without \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR will result in an
error.
.IP "do_not_chain_handlers" 4
.IX Item "do_not_chain_handlers"
If this option is set to a true value, then only one handler will be called for
each element, even if several satisfy the condition
.Sp
Note that the \f(CW\*(C`_all_\*(C'\fR handler will still be called regardeless
.IP "ignore_elts" 4
.IX Item "ignore_elts"
This option lets you ignore elements when building the twig. This is useful 
in cases where you cannot use \f(CW\*(C`twig_roots\*(C'\fR to ignore elements, for example if
the element to ignore is a sibling of elements you are interested in.
.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  my $twig= XML::Twig\->new( ignore_elts => { elt => 1 });
\&  $twig\->parsefile( 'doc.xml');
.Ve
.Sp
This will build the complete twig for the document, except that all \f(CW\*(C`elt\*(C'\fR 
elements (and their children) will be left out.
.IP "char_handler" 4
.IX Item "char_handler"
A reference to a subroutine that will be called every time \f(CW\*(C`PCDATA\*(C'\fR is found.
.Sp
The subroutine receives the string as argument, and returns the modified string:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  # we want all strings in upper case
\&  sub my_char_handler
\&    { my( $text)= @_;
\&      $text= uc( $text);

.Ve
.IP "elt_class" 4
.IX Item "elt_class"
The name of a class used to store elements. this class should inherit from
\&\f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Elt\*(C'\fR (and by default it is \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig::Elt\*(C'\fR). This option is used
to subclass the element class and extend it with new methods.
.Sp
This option is needed because during the parsing of the \s-1XML\s0, elements are created
by \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig\*(C'\fR, without any control from the user code.
.IP "keep_atts_order" 4
.IX Item "keep_atts_order"
Setting this option to a true value causes the attribute hash to be tied to
a \f(CW\*(C`Tie::IxHash\*(C'\fR object.
This means that \f(CW\*(C`Tie::IxHash\*(C'\fR needs to be installed for this option to be 
available. It also means that the hash keeps its order, so you will get 
the attributes in order. This allows outputing the attributes in the same 
order as they were in the original document.
.IP "keep_encoding" 4
.IX Item "keep_encoding"
This is a (slightly?) evil option: if the \s-1XML\s0 document is not \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded and
you want to keep it that way, then setting keep_encoding will use the\f(CW\*(C`Expat\*(C'\fR 
original_string method for character, thus keeping the original encoding, as 
well as the original entities in the strings.
.Sp
See the \f(CW\*(C`t/test6.t\*(C'\fR test file to see what results you can expect from the 
various encoding options.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1WARNING\s0\fR: if the original encoding is multi-byte then attribute parsing will
be \s-1EXTREMELY\s0 unsafe under any Perl before 5.6, as it uses regular expressions
which do not deal properly with multi-byte characters. You can specify an 
alternate function to parse the start tags with the \f(CW\*(C`parse_start_tag\*(C'\fR option

same as output_filter, except it doesn't apply to the brackets and quotes

.IX Item "parse_start_tag"
If you use the \f(CW\*(C`keep_encoding\*(C'\fR option then this option can be used to replace
the default parsing function. You should provide a coderef (a reference to a 
subroutine) as the argument, this subroutine takes the original tag (given

process the entities before outputting it.

A 'variable' is any text of the form ${name} (or \f(CW$name\fR) which occurs in an attribute value or in the text content of an element.

Wrap the children of the element that match the regexp in an element \f(CW$tag\fR.
If \f(CW$optional_attribute_hashref\fR is passed then the new element will
have these attributes.
.Sp
The \f(CW$regexp_string\fR includes tags, within pointy brackets, as in 
\&\f(CW\*(C`<title><para>+\*(C'\fR and the usual Perl modifiers (+*?...). 
Tags can be further qualified with attributes:
\&\f(CW\*(C`<para type="warning" classif="cosmic_secret">+\*(C'\fR. The values
for attributes should be xml\-escaped: \f(CW\*(C`<candy type="M&amp;Ms">*\*(C'\fR
(\f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR \fB\f(CB\*(C`>\*(C'\fB\fR and \f(CW\*(C`"\*(C'\fR should be escaped).

Note that elements might get extra \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR attributes in the process. See add_id.
Use strip_att to remove unwanted id's.

subs_text does text substitution, similar to perl's \f(CW\*(C` s///\*(C'\fR operator.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$regexp\fR must be a perl regexp, created with the \f(CW\*(C`qr\*(C'\fR operatot.
.Sp
\&\f(CW$replace\fR can include \f(CW\*(C`$1, $2\*(C'\fR... from the \f(CW$regexp\fR. It can also be

or, using a variable:

Note that the substitution is always global, as in using the \f(CW\*(C`g\*(C'\fR modifier
in a perl substitution, and that it is performed on all text descendants
of the element.

\&\fBBug\fR: in the \f(CW$regexp\fR, you can only use \f(CW\*(C`\e1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e2\*(C'\fR... if the replacement

Quoting and interpolating variables can be a pain when the Perl syntax and the

If you use the load_DTD option when creating the twig the \s-1DTD\s0 information and
the entity declarations can be accessed.

The \s-1DTD\s0 and the entity declarations will be \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR'ed (or \f(CW\*(C`print\*(C'\fR'ed) either
as is (if they have not been modified) or as reconstructed (poorly, comments 
are lost, order is not kept, due to it's content this \s-1DTD\s0 should not be viewed 
by anyone) if they have been modified. You can also modify them directly by 
changing the \f(CW\*(C`$twig\->{twig_doctype}\->{internal}\*(C'\fR field (straight from 
XML::Parser, see the \f(CW\*(C`Doctype\*(C'\fR handler doc)
.IP "External \s-1DTD\s0" 4
.IX Item "External DTD"
The \s-1XML\s0 document includes a reference to an external \s-1DTD\s0, and maybe entity

You can change the doctype through the \f(CW\*(C`$twig\->set_doctype\*(C'\fR method and 
print the dtd through the \f(CW\*(C`$twig\->dtd_text\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`$twig\->dtd_print\*(C'\fR
 methods.
.Sp
If you need to modify the entity list this is probably the easiest way to do it.
.Sh "Flush"

If you set handlers and use \f(CW\*(C`flush\*(C'\fR, do not forget to flush the twig one
last time \s-1AFTER\s0 the parsing, or you might be missing the end of the document.
.PP
Remember that element handlers are called when the element is \s-1CLOSED\s0, so
if you have handlers for nested elements the inner handlers will be called
first. It makes it for example trickier than it would seem to number nested
clauses.
.SH "BUGS"

.IX Item "entity handling"
Due to XML::Parser behaviour, non-base entities in attribute values disappear:
\&\f(CW\*(C`att="val&ent;"\*(C'\fR will be turned into \f(CW\*(C`att => val\*(C'\fR, unless you use the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`keep_encoding\*(C'\fR argument to \f(CW\*(C`XML::Twig\->new\*(C'\fR 
.IP "\s-1DTD\s0 handling" 4
.IX Item "DTD handling"
The \s-1DTD\s0 handling methods are quite bugged. No one uses them and
it seems very difficult to get them to work in all cases, including with 
several slightly incompatible versions of XML::Parser and of libexpat.
.Sp
Basically you can read the \s-1DTD\s0, output it back properly, and update entities,
but not much more.
.Sp
So use XML::Twig with standalone documents, or with documents refering to an
external \s-1DTD\s0, but don't expect it to properly parse and even output back the
\&\s-1DTD\s0.
.IP "memory leak" 4

If you use a lot of twigs you might find that you leak quite a lot of memory
(about 2Ks per twig). You can use the \f(CW\*(C`dispose \*(C'\fR method to free 
that memory after you are done.
.Sp
If you create elements the same thing might happen, use the \f(CW\*(C`delete\*(C'\fR
method to get rid of them.
.Sp
Alternatively installing the \f(CW\*(C`Scalar::Util\*(C'\fR (or \f(CW\*(C`WeakRef\*(C'\fR) module on a version 
of Perl that supports it (>5.6.0) will get rid of the memory leaks automagically.

Pretty printing (at least using the '\f(CW\*(C`indented\*(C'\fR' style) is hard to get right!

.IX Item "multiple twigs are not well supported"
A number of twig features are just global at the moment. These include
the \s-1ID\s0 list and the \*(L"tag pool\*(R" (if you use \f(CW\*(C`change_gi\*(C'\fR then you change the tag 
for \s-1ALL\s0 twigs).
.Sp
A future version will try to support this while trying not to be to
hard on performance (at least when a single twig is used!).

.Sh "Alternative Modules"
.IX Subsection "Alternative Modules"
XML::Twig is not the only XML::Processing module available on \s-1CPAN\s0 (far from 
it!).
.PP
The main alternative I would recommend is XML::LibXML. 
.PP
Here is a quick comparison of the 2 modules:
.PP
XML::LibXML, actually \f(CW\*(C`libxml2\*(C'\fR on which it is based, sticks to the standards,
and implements a good number of them in a rather strict way: \s-1XML\s0, XPath, \s-1DOM\s0, 
RelaxNG, I must be forgetting a couple (XInclude?). It is fast and rather 
frugal memory\-wise.
.PP
XML::Twig is older: when I started writing it XML::Parser/expat was the only 
game in town. It implements \s-1XML\s0 and that's about it (plus a subset of XPath, 
and you can use XML::Twig::XPath if you have XML::XPath installed for full 
support). It is slower and requires more memory for a full tree than 
XML::LibXML. On the plus side (yes, there is a plus side!) it lets you process
a big document in chunks, and thus let you tackle documents that couldn't be 
loaded in memory by XML::LibXML, and it offers a lot (and I mean a \s-1LOT\s0!) of 
higher-level methods, for everything, from adding structure to \*(L"low\-level\*(R" \s-1XML\s0,
to shortcuts for \s-1XHTML\s0 conversions and more. It also DWIMs quite a bit, getting
comments and non-significant whitespaces out of the way but preserving them in 
the output for example. As it does not stick to the \s-1DOM\s0, is also usually leads 
to shorter code than in XML::LibXML.
.PP
Beyond the pure features of the 2 modules, XML::LibXML seems to be prefered by
\&\*(L"XML\-purists\*(R", while XML::Twig seems to be more used by Perl Hackers who have 
to deal with \s-1XML\s0. As you have noted, XML::Twig also comes with quite a lot of 
docs, but I am sure if you ask for help about XML::LibXML here or on Perlmonks
you will get answers.
.PP
Note that it is actually quite hard for me to compare the 2 modules: on one hand
I know XML::Twig inside-out and I can get it to do pretty much anything I need 
to (or I improve it ;\-\-), while I have a very basic knowledge of XML::LibXML. 
So feature\-wise, I'd rather use XML::Twig ;\-\-). On the other hand, I am 
painfully aware of some of the deficiencies, potential bugs and plain ugly code
that lurk in XML::Twig, even though you are unlikely to be affected by them 
(unless for example you need to change the \s-1DTD\s0 of a document programatically),
while I haven't looked much into XML::LibXML so it still looks shinny and clean
to me.
.PP
That said, ifyou need to process a document that is too big to fit memory
and XML::Twig is too slow for you, my reluctant advice would be to use \*(L"bare\*(R"
XML::Parser.  It won't be as easy to use as XML::Twig: basically with XML::Twig
you trade some speed (depending on what you do from a factor 3 to... none) 
for ease\-of\-use, but it will be easier \s-1IMHO\s0 than using \s-1SAX\s0 (albeit not 
standard), and at this point a \s-1LOT\s0 faster (see the last test in
<http://www.xmltwig.com/article/simple_benchmark/>).
